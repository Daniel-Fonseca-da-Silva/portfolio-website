          I worked at Equiplano, a company specialized in developing public management systems. During my time there, I was responsible for serving several cities in the state of Paran√°, developing software to meet the needs of city halls and improve local public management. I had the opportunity to work on three main systems:

        <li className="text-base flex gap-2 sm:text-sm text-textDark">
